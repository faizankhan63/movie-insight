Dashboard Assignment Documentation

As part of the task, I designed and developed a responsive React-based dashboard using TailwindCSS. Below is an overview of my work:

What I Did
	1.	Widget Selection:
	•	Oscar Statistics Overview: A line chart displaying nominations and wins by year.
	•	Search and Filter Panel: Allows users to filter movies by attributes like genre, year, and language.
	2.	Dataset:
	•	Used the provided dataset and enriched it with YouTube links for a better user experience.
	3.	Implementation:
	•	Used data in json file and React’s useState/useEffect for state management.
	•	Ensured responsiveness with TailwindCSS.
	•	Visualized data using apexChart for an engaging UI.
	4.	Enhancements:
	•	Added debounce search to improve performance.
	•	Focused on a clean, mobile-first design.

Trade-Offs
	•	Focused on three widgets to deliver quality within the time frame.
	•	Kept visualizations simple for better user understanding.

Future Improvements
	•	Add more widgets (e.g., heatmap for country insights).
	•	Optimize performance further with caching and pagination.
	•	Improve accessibility with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.
